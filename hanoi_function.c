* \fn void tower_of_hanoi( int no_of_stories, char silver_plate[], char bronze_plate[], char golden_plate[] )
* @param no_of_stories - the number of stories , data input
* @param silver_plate - string that keeps the name of this plate
* @param bronze_plate - string that keeps the name of this plate
* @param golden_plate - string that keeps the name of this plate
* @brief Implement the recursive algorithm.

* If the number of stories (the data input) is equal with 1, then we have only one move to do.
* This is the condition to return from recursivity.
* First, we implement the solution for the stories, besides the largest
    supposing that we need to push them on the auxiliary plate( bronze ).
    The largest story will be moved from silver to golden plate.
    After that, we will move, in recursive way, those plates from bronze plate to destination plate.
